# Python
## Overview 
This is going to be a repo for all of my python projects. 
## Projects
### Hangman.py
This is the first addition to this repo. This is a command-line HangMan game that leverages a free Random Word API to pick a word. I wrote this game for fun in about an hour, so feel free to add on!
